//A truck can transport a maximum of 10000 kgs. Assume a heap of load containing 41 boxes should be shipped through the truck. The box weight of this sort of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of 210 kgs and standard deviation of 15 kgs. What is the probability that all 41 boxes can be loaded into the truck and transported?
